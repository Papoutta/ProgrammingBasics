1) How have you noticed your bootcamp knowledge grow or change during Programming Basics?

Yes, i've learned many new concepts in js and my logic is getting better.

2) How have you noticed your approach to learning change throughout Programming Basics?

"It helps you understand that the learning process involves more than just learning to program."

3) What do you consider your "Mistake of the Week," which was a valuable failure you learned from during Programming Basics?

The biggest mistake of the week was the infinite loop in questions 8 or 9 on the first exam. I intended to decrement with 'i--', but I mistakenly wrote 'i++' instead.
